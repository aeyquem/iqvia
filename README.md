# project
Could you display US state-level confirmed COVID-19 case counts in a table ordered descending by % of US Confirmed Covid-19 Cases for the most recent submission date available? The table should contain the following columns:
- State
- Submission Date
- Confirmed Covid-19 Cases
- % of US Confirmed Covid-19 Cases
  - Calculated as a percentage of state confirmed cases out of the entire United States

This page also needs to include a state filter so a user can easily filter the results by a certain state.
